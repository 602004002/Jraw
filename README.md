# Jraw
Java drawing software.

What is this software?
  Jraw is a drawing/painting/art program that allows its end-users to collaborate on a single canvas to produce digital works of art similar to how Google Docs allows multiple end-users to work on a shared document simultaneously while providing a similar experience to that of something like Clip Studio Paint.
